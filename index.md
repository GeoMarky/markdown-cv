## Summary

An innovative and visionary leader with a strong background in Physics and Mathematics, specializing in leveraging cutting-edge technology to address complex challenges in the energy industry. Proven success in implementing data science solutions, managing teams, and scaling solutions.

## Currently

Leading Data Science efforts applied to seismic data on the largest collection of seismic and sub-surface data in the world.

## Occupation

`2023-now`
__Lead Data Scientist__, TGS, Houston

- Lead efforts of a dynamic team of data scientists, computer vision specialists, and software developers in pioneering advanced data science solutions.
- Spearhead research and development efforts in computer vision technologies, utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models for seismic image analysis, regression, and segmentation tasks.
- Leading a project to investigate ML based approaches to augmentent/accelerate conventional physics based inversion processes (such as Full Waveform Inversion)
- Matured MLOps by adopting MLFlow as a model registry and inference at scale on-prem and on the cloud for petabyte sized datasets.
- Successfully prototyped an interactive web app utilizing the Segment-Anything-Model (SAM) for interactive segmentation of seismic data.  The solution was generalized to handle 3D data.

`2020-2023`
__Manager of Software Innovation__, TGS, Houston

- Established and managed a cross-functional team to develop a robust framework for orchestrating and automating workloads in a hybrid on-premises and cloud environment (bursting workloads up to ~10,000 GPUs).
- Implemented a web-based frontend for secure job monitoring and quality control.
- Pioneered a loosely coupled, node-based workflow orchestration system via REST-based services.
- Introduced asynchronous execution techniques to enhance robustness and reduce total runtime.
- Automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform to streamline the migration of compute tasks from on-premises to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- Collaborated with the Data Analytics group to develop and deploy machine learning solutions, optimizing data-driven insights.

`2017-2020`
__Advising Research Geophysicist__, TGS, Houston

- Developed machine learning-based velocity estimation solution, with potential to reduce turnaround time for seismic imaging projects.
- Integrated and extended seismic depth imaging software (RTM and FWI) from Waveseis into Spectrum Geo's internal processing suite(prior to Spectrum's acquisition by TGS in 2019), aligning it with the company's evolving needs.

`2012-2017`
__Founder__, Waveseis LLC, Denver

- Founded, and successfully sold a specialized company offering high-end seismic depth imaging services for the oil and gas industry.
- Developed a cloud-based pipeline for seismic imaging using AWS, combining Python for pipeline orchestration and C++ for seismic processing.

`2007-2012`
__Geophysicist__, BP America, Houston

- Contributed to BP's Advanced Seismic Imaging R&D team, specializing in Fortran, MPI, and OpenMP for seismic depth imaging.
- Developed and patented innovative seismic imaging solutions.
- Collaborated with the Atlantis Reservoir Management team on seismic interpretation and strategic planning for seismic acquisition/processing.


## Education

`2003-2007`
__Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris__, Doctorate in Geophysics

- Full waveform-inversion as a tool for elastic parameter estimation from look- ahead walk-away Vertical Seismic Profile data

`2002-2003`
__Durham University__, M.Sc. in Geophysics

`1998-2002`
__Oxford University__, M.Phys. in Physics
